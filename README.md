A Home Assistant integration for Kospel electric heaters that allows you to monitor and control your heating devices via Modbus TCP protocol using the C.MI internet module.

## Features

- üå°Ô∏è Read current temperature and settings
- üéØ Set target temperature
- üíß Monitor water heating status and temperature  
- ‚ö° Monitor heater running status and power consumption
- üìä Monitor operating modes and error codes
- üîÑ Real-time updates via Modbus TCP
- üè† Full Home Assistant integration with entities

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> **READ ALL WARNINGS ABOVE BEFORE INSTALLING**
> 
> Only install if you:
> - Are a developer/tester
> - Understand the risks
> - Have Kospel C.MI hardware for testing
> - Can troubleshoot Modbus issues

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Navigate to "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner and select "Custom repositories"
4. Add `https://github.com/username/ha-kospel-integration` as repository
5. Select "Integration" as category
6. Click "Add"
7. Search for "Kospel" and install
8. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/username/ha-kospel-integration/releases)
2. Create a directory called `kospel` in your `custom_components` folder
3. Extract all Python files (`*.py`), `manifest.json`, `strings.json`, and `translations/` folder to `custom_components/kospel/`
4. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Kospel electric heater with C.MI (Internet Module) installed
- C.MI module connected to your network via Ethernet
- Modbus TCP enabled on the C.MI module

### Setup

Add the integration through the Home Assistant UI:

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for "Kospel"
4. Configure the connection:
   - **Host**: IP address of your C.MI module
   - **Port**: Modbus TCP port (default: 502)
   - **Slave ID**: Modbus device ID (default: 1)
   - **Username/Password**: Optional authentication credentials

## Supported Models

This integration is designed to work with Kospel electric heaters equipped with the C.MI internet module:

- Kospel EPO/EPV series with C.MI
- Kospel EKC series with C.MI  
- Any Kospel heater with C.MI module that supports Modbus TCP

## Protocol Details

The integration uses **Modbus TCP** protocol to communicate with Kospel heaters through the C.MI internet module. The following data is monitored and controlled:

### Monitored Values
- Current room temperature
- Target temperature settings
- Heater running status
- Water heating status and temperature
- Operating mode (Off, Heat, Auto, Eco)
- Power consumption
- Error codes

### Controllable Settings
- Target temperature (5¬∞C - 35¬∞C)
- Operating mode
- Water heating temperature (20¬∞C - 60¬∞C)

## Development Status

> [!CAUTION]
> **EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE - USE WITH CAUTION**

This integration is currently in **experimental development phase**. Implementation status:

### ‚úÖ **Completed (Theoretical)**
- Basic project structure with HACS support
- Modbus TCP communication protocol implementation
- Temperature reading and control logic
- Water heating monitoring and control logic
- Operating mode control implementation
- Status monitoring (heater running, power, errors)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL LIMITATIONS**
- **NOT TESTED** with real Kospel C.MI hardware
- **UNKNOWN** if Modbus register addresses are correct
- **NO VALIDATION** of actual device communication
- **POTENTIAL** for device damage if registers are wrong

### üöß **In Development**
- Hardware testing and validation
- Register address verification
- Error handling improvements
- Advanced features and configuration options
- Multi-zone support
- Energy monitoring and statistics

### üéØ **Testing Needed**
- Real Kospel C.MI hardware validation
- Modbus register mapping verification
- Temperature control testing
- Water heating control testing
- Error condition handling

## Important Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DISCLAIMER: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Protocol Implementation**: The Modbus register addresses used in this integration are **ESTIMATED** based on common heating system implementations and research. Since official Kospel C.MI Modbus documentation was not publicly available, the actual register addresses may need adjustment based on your specific device.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Risks**: Incorrect Modbus commands could potentially damage your heating system. The authors are not responsible for any damage caused by using this integration.

üîß **For Developers**: If you have access to official Kospel C.MI Modbus documentation or have successfully tested this integration, please contribute by opening issues or pull requests with correct register mappings.

üìã **Before Using**: 
- Backup your heater settings
- Test in a safe environment first
- Monitor system behavior closely
- Have alternative heating methods available
